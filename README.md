# Keyword-Counter
A script to count keywords in a .txt file and draw a Histogram of the most represented.

The final result is a Histogram. Instead of .savefig function in Python, i used the Manual save option available when plotting a graph with pyplot. The reason for this is resolution issues that couldn't be fixed.
The .txt file was retrieved from an open source science journal database. The Words in the file represent keywords for articles.
